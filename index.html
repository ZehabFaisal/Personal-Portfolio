            <h3> Project 1: Tribute Page (Quaid-e-Azam) </h3>
            <p> Creating a tribute page for Quaid-e-Azam using HTML and CSS
                is a meaningful project that allows me to honor the founder
                of Pakistan while honing my web development skills. 
                This project involves designing a single-page website that 
                highlights important aspects of Quaid-e-Azam's life, 
                achievements, and legacy. This project also helps me practice
                key web design concepts like layout, font styling, and 
                other responsive design. </p>
